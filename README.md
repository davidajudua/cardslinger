# CardSlinger

**Sling cards to your team, one at a time.**

CardSlinger is a Discord bot that manages and distributes cards to your team through slash commands. Load your cards, set permissions, and let your team request what they need — with built-in safeguards, admin controls, and full activity logging.

> **Why "CardSlinger"?** It slings cards — one at a time, on demand, to whoever needs one.

---

## Use Cases

- Distributing virtual cards (VCCs) to staff for purchases
- Issuing gift cards, promo codes, or license keys to a team
- Any workflow where items need to be handed out one at a time with tracking

---

## How It Works

1. An admin loads cards into the bot (CSV upload or manual entry)
2. A team member runs `/card` and gets one card assigned to them
3. They mark the card with a button:
   - **Used** — done, card is consumed forever
   - **Not Used** — returns it to the pool (with confirmation)
   - **Error** — flags it as bad, auto-assigns a new one
4. They can't request another card until the current one is resolved

That's it. No spreadsheets, no DMs, no manual tracking.

## Safeguards

- One card at a time per user — no hoarding
- Used and errored cards are **never** recycled
- "Not Used" requires a confirmation step to prevent accidents
- Buttons only work for the assigned user
- Persistent buttons survive bot restarts
- Low stock warnings ping your admin role
- Multi-server support — each server has independent settings

---

## Quick Start

### Option A: Python

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidajudua/cardslinger.git
cd cardslinger
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Windows?** Use `venv\Scripts\activate` instead of `source venv/bin/activate`.

Open the `.env` file in any text editor and replace `your-bot-token-here` with your actual bot token. Then start the bot:

```bash
python bot.py
```

### Option B: Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidajudua/cardslinger.git
cd cardslinger
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and replace `your-bot-token-here` with your actual bot token. Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Auto-restarts on crash. View logs with `docker compose logs -f`.

## Creating a Discord Bot

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. **New Application** → name it → go to the **Bot** tab
3. **Reset Token** → copy it (this goes in your `.env`)
4. Enable **Server Members Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
5. Go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator** → select `bot` + `applications.commands`
6. Under Bot Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Use Slash Commands`, `Read Message History`
7. Open the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

---

## First-Time Setup (in Discord)

1. `/setadminrole @YourAdminRole` — who can manage the bot
2. `/setcardrole @YourTeamRole` — who can request cards
3. `/setlogchannel #logs` — where activity gets logged
4. `/loadcards` — upload a CSV to fill the pool
5. Your team can now use `/card`

---

## CSV Format

```csv
provider,card_number,exp_date,cvv,zip_code
C,5187259558019101,03/2031,698,90703
A,374512349876001,11/2029,4821,10001
M,4000123456789010,06/2028,331,30301
```

The `provider` column is freeform — it displays exactly as written. Duplicates are automatically skipped.
